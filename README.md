# The Strategy of Technology
This is a an exercise in which I aim to 
  1. Become comfortable with basic LaTeX. 
  2. Generate a readable version of the document.

As stated on Jerry's [website](https://www.jerrypournelle.com/slowchange/Strat.html), this book is a form of shareware. You may find additional information on where to send funds if you find this edition of the book useful. If Dr. Possony's or Dr. Pournelle's estates wish for me to take this information down, I will be happy to oblige.

## To Do:
  - Break up .TEX file from monolithic structure
  - Learn best practices for formatting commentary added later
    - Footnotes vs Bounding Boxes?
  - Go back and clean up missing endnotes/footnotes
